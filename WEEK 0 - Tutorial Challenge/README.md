### Question 1: Tutorial Message

**Task:** Decode the Base64-encoded content in `tutorial.txt` and extract the exercise answer.

**Encoded Content:**
```
TXVmZmluIHRoZSBjYXQgY2xpY2tlZCBvbiBhIGxpbmssCk5vdyBhbGwgaGlzIGZpbGVzIGJlZ2FuIHRvIHNocmluayEKSGUgc2hvdWxk4oCZdmUgY2hlY2tlZCB0aGUgc2VuZGVy4oCZcyBuYW1lLApCdXQgbm93IGhpcyBsYXB0b3AncyBub3QgdGhlIHNhbWUuCgpBIHBhc3N3b3JkIHN0cm9uZywgYSBmaXJld2FsbCB0aWdodCwKS2VlcHMgc25lYWt5IGhhY2tlcnMgb3V0IG9mIHNpZ2h0LgpTbyB0aGluayBiZWZvcmUgeW91IHN1cmYgYW5kIHBsYXnigJQKQ3liZXItc21hcnRzIHdpbGwgc2F2ZSB0aGUgZGF5IQoKVGhlIGFuc3dlciB0byB0aGlzIGV4ZXJjaXNlIGlzICJUcnlIYXJkZXIi
```

**Decoded Message:**
```
Muffin the cat clicked on a link,
Now all his files began to shrink!
He should've checked the sender's name,
But now his laptop's not the same.

A password strong, a firewall tight,
Keeps sneaky hackers out of sight.
So think before you surf and play—
Cyber-smarts will save the day!

The answer to this exercise is "TryHarder"
```

**Answer:**
```
TryHarder
```

### Question 2: Log Analysis - Path Traversal Attack

**Task:** Analyze the `access.log` file and identify the path traversal attack. Provide the source IP address, malicious request path, and target file.

**Answer:**

**Source IP Address:**
```
192.168.1.101
```

**Malicious Request:**
```
GET /public/plugins/welcome/../../../../../../../../home/dave/.ssh/id_rsa HTTP/1.1
```

**Target File:**
```
/home/dave/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**Attack Details:**
- **Timestamp:** 01/Oct/2025:08:17:55 +0000
- **HTTP Method:** GET
- **Status Code:** 200 (Successful - Attack succeeded!)
- **Response Size:** 1,678 bytes
- **User Agent:** Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)
- **Directory Traversal Depth:** 8 levels (../../../../../../../../)

---

### Question 3: Additional Suspicious Activities

**Task:** Identify other suspicious activities in the access logs.

**Answer:**

**Authentication Failure:**
- **IP:** 192.168.1.20
- **Request:** POST /api/auth
- **Status:** 401 Unauthorized
- **Timestamp:** 01/Oct/2025:08:04:32 +0000
- **Note:** Followed by successful authentication attempt 8 seconds later

**Server Errors:**
1. **Upload Failure:**
   - **IP:** 172.16.0.2
   - **Request:** POST /api/upload
   - **Status:** 500 Internal Server Error
   - **User Agent:** PostmanRuntime/7.32.0

2. **Forbidden Access:**
   - **IP:** 172.16.0.2
   - **Request:** GET /metrics
   - **Status:** 403 Forbidden
   - **User Agent:** curl/7.68.0

**Missing Resource:**
- **IP:** 192.168.1.99
- **Request:** GET /favicon.ico
- **Status:** 404 Not Found

## 🔬 Technical Analysis

### Base64 Decoding Method

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
[System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String("TXVmZmluIH..."))
```

**Python:**
```python
import base64
decoded = base64.b64decode("TXVmZmluIH...").decode('utf-8')
print(decoded)
```

**Linux/Bash:**
```bash
echo "TXVmZmluIH..." | base64 -d
```

### Path Traversal Attack Analysis

The attack exploits insufficient path validation in the web application:

```
/public/plugins/welcome/../../../../../../../../home/dave/.ssh/id_rsa
```

**Attack Chain:**
1. Start at the legitimate path: `/public/plugins/welcome/`
2. Traverse up 8 directory levels using `../`
3. Navigate to the target: `/home/dave/.ssh/id_rsa`
4. Successfully retrieve SSH private key (1,678 bytes returned)

**Vulnerability Type:** CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')

## 🛡️ Security Lessons Learned

### From the Poem

1. **Phishing Awareness:** Always verify sender information before clicking links
2. **Strong Authentication:** Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication
3. **Firewall Protection:** Implement network security controls
4. **Security Mindfulness:** Think before interacting with untrusted content

### From Log Analysis

1. **Path Traversal Prevention:**
   - Validate and sanitize all user input
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Use allow-lists for file access
   - Never trust client-supplied paths

2. **Monitoring & Detection:**
   - Implement real-time log monitoring
   - Set up alerts for suspicious patterns (e.g., `../` in URLs)
   - Track failed authentication attempts
   - Monitor error rates and anomalies

3. **Incident Response:**
   - The 200 status code indicates successful data exfiltration
   - SSH private key compromise = immediate credential rotation required
   - IP 192.168.1.101 should be blocked and investigated
   - All SSH keys for user 'dave' must be regenerated

---

## 🚨 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Revoke Compromised Credentials:**
   - Regenerate all SSH keys for user 'dave'
   - Rotate any passwords for affected accounts
   - Audit access logs for unauthorized access attempts

2. **Block Malicious IP:**
   - Add 192.168.1.101 to firewall blocklist
   - Investigate source and motivation of attack
   - Check for other attacks from same IP range

3. **Patch Vulnerability:**
   - Implement path traversal protection
   - Update web application framework
   - Add input validation and sanitization

### Long-Term Improvements

1. **Security Controls:**
   - Deploy Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - Implement file access restrictions
   - Use principle of least privilege
   - Enable security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Set up SIEM for centralized log analysis
   - Configure alerts for path traversal patterns
   - Monitor for unusual file access attempts
   - Track authentication failures

3. **Training:**
   - Security awareness training for all users
   - Phishing simulation exercises
   - Secure coding practices for developers
   - Incident response drills
